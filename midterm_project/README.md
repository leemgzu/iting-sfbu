# Express HTTPS Server for Tracking Information

This Node.js application sets up an HTTPS server using Express to fetch tracking information based on order numbers from customers. It uses Postman to retrieve order numbers and then queries a tracking service to obtain the relevant tracking data.

## Prerequisites

Before running this application, make sure you have the following:

- Node.js installed on your system.
- A valid SSL certificate and private key for HTTPS (key.pem and cert.pem).

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the code.

2. Install the required Node.js packages by running the following command:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API key for the tracking service like this:

   ```
   API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

4. Start the application by running:

   ```
   node index.js
   ```

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can make POST requests to fetch tracking information. Send a JSON object with an orderNumber to the `/tracking_detail` endpoint:

```json
{
  "orderNumber": "your_order_number_here"
}
```

The server will respond with the tracking information for the provided order number if it's available. If the order number is invalid or the tracking information cannot be found, appropriate error messages will be returned.

## HTTPS Configuration

This application is configured to run on HTTPS. To set up your own SSL certificate and private key for development and production, replace the `key.pem` and `cert.pem` files with your own certificate and key files.

## Important Notes

- Ensure that you keep your API key secure. The key is loaded from the `.env` file for secure usage.

- This application is a basic example and should be further enhanced for production use, including error handling, security, and better API key management.

- You can customize the port (currently set to 8080) and other configurations as needed.
